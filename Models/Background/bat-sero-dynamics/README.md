# bat-sero-dynamics

Here, we pull in the calculations of which bats are seropositive/negative from the [luminex repo](https://github.com/brooklabteam/luminex-serology) and from the historical luminex data, join with age info from the [Madagascar-Bat-Data](https://github.com/brooklabteam/Madagascar-Bat-Data) repo, and fit mechanistic models of sge-seroprevalence.
